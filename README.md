# Web-Development
#This is an Attendance Management System coded in django.
The web-app takes the input of an xlsx file containing the attendance records of employees for a month.
Then stores the details in the databse and displays the employee list.
The user can click on any user's name and then his/her monthly attendance will be displayed and the user can modify the record for any particular day.
One can run django through windows powershell.
For activating django: ./Scripts/activate
For running the server: python manage.py runserver
If you have made any changes to the model, enter the following commands:
